This is then followed by 166 m with repetitive coarsening upward rhythms, and then 20 m of lacustrine shales. The formation is topped by interbedded sands and shales with a thickness of 104 m. In natural exposures, the much thinner 40 m development of the formation is developed as a dominantly dark claystone, with well-defined, mainly laterally continuous, thin ferruginous coarse sandstone beds.

Increasing nearshore lacustrine interbeds in the upper parts of the formation were however noted by Roller et al. [9]. The thick Turaco section suggests a development which introduced coarse deltaic clastics into the basin. Palynofacies associations suggest a shift from more open lacustrine to nearshore environments about 200 m above formational base [14] or the development of humid fan delta/mouth bar deposits throughout [13].\r\n",macrofossils,,,,,,,,body,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETE Abrasion: ., ETE Assemblage formation: attritional, ETE transport: ., ETE weathering/trampling: ., ETE part concentration: ., ETE time represented: . ,ETE vert pres: ., ETE invert pres: ., ETE plant pres: .",general faunal/floral,bulk,,,2 specimens,,,,"ETE Size: macro; ETE reference list: 926, ; ETE museum list: ",,"paleobotany,vertebrate",marine,,actively mobile,,,carnivore,,,,hydroxyapatite,,,

Laterally and a few hundred of meters away from this site, some marine deposits contain benthic foraminifera that give an Aquitanian/Early Langhian age (Anglada in Lalaï, 1986). This micro-mammal fossil site is attributed to MN4 (Aguilar et al., 1999, 1996), a micromammal zone that covers the late Burdigalian/ Early Langhian interval. The occurrence of Avicennia pollen in this dark layer (Châteauneuf et al., in press; Jimenez- Moreno, 2005), gives an age range similar to that deduced from the micomammal fauna (Bessedik et Cabrera, 1985).  The Châteauredon 1 site (MN4) corresponds to a mammal zone whose stratigraphic attribution is largely variable. According to the authors its extension varies between 16.5 to 17.5 Ma (Kempf et al., 1997) and 15.8 to 16.6 Ma (Agusti et al., 2001). The beginning of the zone is placed at 17.6 Ma by Aguilar and collaborators (2003).

More recently, the Etadunna Formation has been proposed to be 26.1-23.6 Ma old based on a best-fit age-model of magnetostratigraphic data. The Pinpa Local Fauna is the oldest of the three distinct faunal units recovered from stratigraphic levels in the Namba Formation, and has been correlated with the oldest faunal zone (Zone A) of the Etadunna Formation, which has been dated as 25.3-24.9 Ma old (chrons 7An and 7Ar) based on magnetostratigraphy.

The snake material we studied was collected at the Talisma  locality, which is considered by some authors as belonging to the Huayquerian- Montehermosan (Late Miocene/Pliocene) because of the presence of the rodents Potamarchus murinus and Neopliblema horridula (Santos et al., 1993; Negri, 2004). According to Santos and Negri (1993), the faunal set of xenarthrans (Tardigrada) suggests, on one hand, a probable affinity with the fauna of the Santacrucian Age of Argentina (Early-Middle Miocene) and, on the other, a relation with the Laventan Age of Colombia (Middle Miocene). According to Negri (2004; unpubl. data), the faunistic association of Tardigrada in this locality would indicate an older age, correlatable and close to the Laventan (13.5–11.8 Ma, Madden et al., 1997). Here, we follow the arguments of Latrubesse et al. (2007) and assume a probable Late Miocene age for the Solimo es Formation."" (Hsiou and Albino, 2009:613)\r\n\r\nCozzuol 2006: The diachronic nature of the Mesopotamian assemblage was rejected by Cozzuol (1993) and, more recently and with more complete data, by Cione et al. (2000). Surprisingly, several authors still insist on the ‘mixed’ nature of the ‘Conglomerado osı´fero’ (Linares, 2004; Zucol et al., 2005). All specimens from the Mesopotamian come from the base of the Ituzaingo´ Formation and concentrate in discontinuous lenticular levels (probably channel filling) known as the ‘Conglomerado osı´fero’ (i.e. bone-bearing conglomerate), which lies on the marine Parana´ Formation with an erosional unconformity between them. Cione et al. (2000) show that there is no basis for considering the Mesopotamian mammals Montehermosan. The Mesopotamian shares with the Chasicoan 18 first generic occurrences (plus 2 more with doubts) and 28 (plus another possible 4) first generic occurrences with the typical Huayquerian. With the constraints imposed by the underlying Parana´ Formation, the upper section of which was dated by several biostratigraphic studies as early Late Miocene (early Tortonian), this information places the Mesopotamian associ- ation well in the Huayquerian SALMA time interval (9.0– 6.8 Ma, Flynn and Swisher, 1995). As shown subsequently, the affinities between the Acre assemblage and the Mesopotamian are very large.\r\n\r\nSantos et al 1993: :Idade Huayqueriense-Montehermosense, Mioceno superior-Plioceno do sudoeste do Estado do Amazonas, Brasil.","dominated by fine sediments, mainly silts and clays, with gypsum and calcite veins in the lower part and manganese stains in the upper part, both probably diagenetic.\r\n\r\n""The section is dominated by fine sediments, mainly silts and clays, with gypsum and calcite veins in the lower part and manganese stains in the upper part, both probably digenetic.

Biswas (1992) considered the Naredi Formation to range from late Paleocene to early Eocene in age. While this age estimate may be reasonable at the type section of the formation (where there is neither lignite nor fossil cetaceans), it appears that this is not the case at Panandhro and Akri Lignite Mines. Here, the stratigraphy is more complex and the beds yielding the whales are best included in the Panandhro Formation of Saraswati and Banerjee (1984, preferred here) or the Lakhpat Formation of Mukhopadhyay and Shome (1996). These beds are equivalent in age to the Harudi Formation: middle/late Lutetian. The Domanda Formation of central Pakistan is also Lutetian in age (Gingerich et al., 2001a).\r\n\r\nSaraswati et al. 2014: The present study refers the fossil-bearing strata of Panandhro to planktic zone P12-P13 and the Bartonian Stage. This validates the strontium stratigraphy within the limit of the analytical error. Some of the estimated ages (see Table 1; Ravikant and Bajpai, 2010) are close to the base of the Bartonian (41.2 Ma as per Gradstein et al., 2012). Therefore, the age of the Panandhro fauna is indisputably Bartonian and more so when the authors report them to have been washed down from the overlying beds.",,"""shale""",,poorly lithified,silty,Y,,,,,,mire/swamp,,Locality is a pit within the Panandhro lignite mines.,macrofossils,,,,,,,,body,good,,,,,,common,,,,,,taxonomic,"surface (float),mechanical,field collection",,all macrofossils,99,,,,,,vertebrate,marine,,actively mobile,,,carnivore,,,,hydroxyapatite,,,

Our study identifies two distinct, highly fossiliferous channel fills at the Trinil site. The stratigraphically lower Bone-Bearing Channel 1 (BBC-1) dates to 830–773 ka, while Bone-Bearing Channel 2 (BBC-2) is substantially younger with a maximum age of 450 ± 110 ka and an inferred minimum age of 430 ± 50 ka. Furthermore, significantly younger T2 terrace deposits are present at similar low elevations as BBC-1 and BBC-2. Our results demonstrate the presence of Early and Middle Pleistocene, and potentially even late Middle to Late Pleistocene fossiliferous sediments within the historical excavation area, suggesting that Dubois excavated fossils from at least three highly fossiliferous units with different ages. Moreover, evidence for reworking suggests that material found in the fossil-rich strata may originate from older deposits, introducing an additional source of temporal heterogeneity in the Trinil fossil assemblage.

This sequence is overlain by a nodular limestone called the Chara Limestone which in turn is overlain by basalt. Below the erosive ase of the Allingham Fm. a lateritic horizon occurs in which channels are cut down filled with basalt pebble-bearing deposits. This implies that the Allingham Fm. in its entirety is coeval with the basaltic volcanism in that area and that basalt flows probably dammed streams and thus created the conditions under which the Allingham Fm. was deposited.

Henningsen (1965) defines this formation as a series of tuffaceous sandstones with intercalations of conglomerates, siltstones and occasionally shales, dark green and brownish green when altered. Mora (1979), describes two subunits according to their sedimentological characteris- tics: The subunit of volcaniclastic conglomerates of gray-green color, overlain by shales that settled in a transitional environ- ment between delta and beach. The subunit of black shales, interspersed with strata of sandstones and fine conglomerates, was deposited in a paralic environment of estuary or swamp type. They are very chloritized and basically consist of subvolcanic products.\r\nThe paleontological material recovered is housed at the Geology Section of the Natural History Department at The National Museum of Costa Rica, and comes from a level of fine conglomerate that is located towards the roof of a sequence of blue clays, which in turn is overlain by a sequence of medium to fine sandstones, which confirms its association with the superior subunit or subunit of shales (sensu Mora, 1979). Granados and Aguilar (1983), based on the presence of molluscs, obtained a Middle-Late Miocene age for the Curré Formation.\r\n\r\n","Subaquatic fan delta: The lithofacies of conglomerates is what characterizes this depositional environment and is composed of blue clay intraclasts, coming from the lower level which it overlies at an erosional discordance. The clasts have diameters that vary between 5 and 13 cm; they are well rounded, little or not spherical; some have point contact, but 90% of them float in a matrix of glauconitic clay. The clasts are arranged with their long axis parallel to the layer of stratification, and it is possible to observe some degree of imbrication. In this sequence are frequent bone and dental remains of various vertebrates, both terrestrial and marine. The Trypanites ichnofacies, in this case, is inferred indirectly from the blue clay intraclasts that are usually perforated by bivalves of the family Pholadidae, from which it is still possible to find remains of the valves within the fossil traces of Gastrochaenolites sp.",conglomerate,,,,,,,,,,deltaic indet.,,,macrofossils,,,,,,,,body,,,,,,,,,,,,,taxonomic,,,,,,,,,,vertebrate,marine,,actively mobile,,,carnivore,,,,hydroxyapatite,,,

Miocene, Santacrucian age assigned. But:\r\n\r\nIn preliminary studies, the Aisol Formation was considered early Miocene (probably Santacrucian SALMA; e.g., Groeber 1951; Dessanti 1954, 1956; González Díaz 1972; Núñez 1976) based upon few fossil findings and stratigraphic correlations. Nonetheless, it is also worth mentioning that in one of those preliminary studies, Groeber (1952) suggested that the unit (informally called «Estratos Calchaquíes» by then) was late Miocene, and was included among the «Arauco-Entrerriano» levels. Later studies did not further the debate. Pascual and Odreman-Rivas (1973; see also Pascual and De la Fuente 1993) placed the Aisol Formation in the Miocene, in the temporal interval between the Santacrucian and Friasian SALMAs. It was after the analysis of new fossil findings that Soria (1983) specifically allocated the Aisol Formation to the Friasian s.l. (including Colloncuran, Friasian s.s., and Mayoan, following Bondesio et al. 1980), because of the occurrence of post-Santacrucian and pre- Chasicoan mammals. This hypothesis was also followed by later authors (Sepúlveda et al. 2001, 2007). The analysis of the new fossil material and the strati- graphic control of the findings led to recognize two dif- ferent fosiliferous sections in the profile, with faunal as- semblages of different ages. The LS is probably middle Miocene, as Soria suggested (1983), perhaps Friasian s.s. (older than 15 Ma; Marshall and Salinas 1990) or Colloncuran (15.5-14 Ma; Marshall et al. 1977; Marshall and Salinas 1990), following the Patagonian scheme. Unfor- tunately, there is no consensus about the time span cov- ered by some of the SALMAs, including the Friasian one. Specific studies on age and taxonomic composition are needed before making any comparisons with more distantly located stratigraphic units.\r\nThree different sections are recognized within the Aisol Formation, with fossil vertebrates in the lower (LS) and middle (MS) sections. According to preliminary results of Forasiepi et al., 2011: Lower Section: Friasian s.s (not used anymore). or Colloncuran and Middle Section: Huayquerian.\r\n",,not reported,,,,,,,,,,terrestrial indet.,,,macrofossils,,,,,,,,body,,,,,,,,,,,,,biostratigraphic,,"MACN,MLP",,,,"Soria; Gonzales Díaz, E.

There are, however, only two currently recognized <i>Caenomeryx</i> species (see Erfurt & Metais, 2007, in Prothero & Foss: The Evolution of Artiodactyls, p. 71) and only one was originally described by Filhol in 1877: <i>Caenomeryx procommunis</i> (orig. comb. <i>Cainotherium procommune</i>). The species cited by Filhol (1877, Ann. Sci. Geol. 8, p. 212) as ""<i>Cainotherium commune</i>, E. Geof."" was actually described by Bravard (1835) and is currently considered a junior synonym of <i>Cainotherium laticurvatum</i> Geoffroy Saint-Hillaire 1833 (Erfurt & Metais, 2007). Hence, the name ""<i>Caenomeryx</i> indet. cf. <i>communis</i> (Filhol, 1877)"" cited by Vianey-Liaud et al.

They did not name the site. Woodburne and Zinsmeister (1984) named the new genus and species _Antarctodolops dailyi_ on the basis of the same specimens and called the site RV-8200. Both abbreviations refer to the University of California at Riverside. According to Woodburne and Zinsmeister (1984), the collection was made in the summer of 1982.\r\n\r\nAs discussed by Marenssi et al. (1994), scientists of the Departamento Científico de Paleontología de Vertebrados of the Museo de La Plata (DPV-MLP) and of the Instituto Antártico Argentino (IAA) collected fossils on Seymour Island starting in the 1980s. In addition to several new sites, they collected additional specimens at the UCR site, now called DPV 6/84. They mention (p. 5) that American authors also call this site ""IPS locality 445"", the ""Rocket Site"", or the ""Mammal Site"".\r\n\r\nDPV 6/84 is located on the southern side of a canyon unofficially named ""Breakwind Canyon"". Woodburne and Zinsmeister (1984) give the coordinates as 64°13'S, 56°40'W, but these coordinates appear to be in the sea northwest of the island. Maps showing the location of DPV 6/84 were published by several authors, including Woodburne and Zinsmeister (1984, fig. 1), Cione and Reguero (1994: fig. 2), Marenssi et al. (1994, fig. 2), Goin et al. (1999, fig. 1), and Chornogubsky et al.

The age model for the La Meseta Formation (and recently-defined Submeseta Formation) is controversial. Strontium isotopes (Ivany et al., 2008) suggest earlier ages, with the La Meseta (Telm1-Telm5) almost entirely Ypresian and the Submeseta (Telm6-Telm7) Middle-Late Eocene. Montes et al. (2013) also created an age model incorporating magnetostratigraphy to support the largely-Ypresian age for the La Meseta and Middle-Late Eocene for the Submeseta. Some mammals are similar to the radiometrically-constrained late early Eocene Paso del Sapo assemblage of Patagonia (Gelfo et al., 2009, Tejedor et al., 2009), but the mammals are not exactly similar (Bond et al., 2011). However, Douglas et al. (2014) re-evaluated the strontium data and used dinoflagellate biostratigraphy to argue for a Lutetian (Telm2-4) and younger (Bartonian to mid-Priabonian for Telm5-6) age range. Amenábar et al. (2019) also found younger ages from dinoflagellates: Lutetian (Telm1-mid Telm 3), Bartonian (mid Telm 3-mid Telm 5), and Priabonian (upper Telm 5), SPDZ10-SPDZ13. This age range is more consistent with the presence of basilosaurid whales in Telm4 and Telm7, as basilosaurids are globally-distributed first in the middle Eocene (Buono et al., 2016). Although the ages are still debated, the dinoflagellate age model of Amenábar et al. (2019) is used here.","Finely laminated beds of silty sandstone, some of which are interbedded with pebbly conglomeratic units interpreted to represent shell banks. The finer-grained beds between the shell banks are finely laminated, and exhibit ripple marks and flaser bedding. Vertical and oblique burrows are common throughout the finer-grained units. Small to large cut-and-fill channel features occur within the sandy siltstone facies. Prominent slump structures and lenses of gravel are associated with these channels. The shell banks consist of individual beds that range in thickness from .5 to 2m, and extend laterally as much as 1km. The banks are characterized by coarse- to fine-grained, well-sorted arkosic sandstone beds that contain pebble- to cobble-sized clasts. Most of the shell banks are extremely fossiliferous.

A study by Wiedman and Feldmann (1988) on the ichnofossil fauna and depositional environment of the La Meseta Formation concluded that the Telm5 setting was a littoral to very shallow sublittoral clastic marine terrain, definitely above storm base and most probably above normal wave base. They agreed with Elliot and Trautrnan (1982) that Units II and III probably represent a tidally dominated environment, but evidence from sedimentary structures is also consistent with a barrier bar model and does not represent a shallowing upward sequence. Elliot and Trautman (1982) favored a deltaic model. The analysis of trace fossils and body fossils (including vertebrate remains and large, abundant wood fragments) indicates variable nearshore, shallow-marine environments. A scenario for the depositional environment could include a combination ebb-tidal (or possibly flood-tidal) delta-barrier island complex (Stilwell & Zinsmeister, 1992).","macrofossils,mesofossils",,,,,,,,body,,allochthonous,time-averaged,,,,,,,,,,taxonomic,"sieve,field collection",,some macrofossils,,,"IAA, DPV/MLP",1982-1990s,"Repository: University of California, Riverside",,"marine invertebrate,vertebrate",marine,,actively mobile,,,carnivore,,,,hydroxyapatite,,,

Based on K/Ar dating of underlying tuff layers, the AGL vertebrate level is considered younger than 7.93 Ma (about 7.5–7.0 Ma) (de Muizon and DeVries, 1985; de Muizon and Bellon, 1986; Lambert and de Muizon, 2013).

This suggests the Peligran SALMA might be early Selandian in age. \r\n\r\nAccording to Andreis et al. (1975), the upper sectionof Salamanca Formation (= Hansen Member) in the San Jorge Gulf area was accumulated under infra-littoral and transitional sea conditions. The sediments were accumulated in low energy environments yielded by submarine bars or littoral banks that had reduced the circulation in a sea with little differences between high and low tides. Based on foraminifera, Bertels (1975) assigned the upper levels of the Salamanca Formation to the Upper Danian. This hypothesis was supported by the 40K/40A isotopic age of 61 ± 5Ma obtained from a vitreous tuff belonging to the Hansen Member at the Ca˜nad´on Hondo locality (Andreis 1977; Marshall et al. 1981). This age was subsequently corrected to 62.6 ± 5Ma byMarshall (1982). Additionally, two more reliable radiometric ages sampled by Marshall et al. (1981) in two basaltic units at or just under the base of the Salamanca Formation yielded ages of 64.0 ± 0.8Ma and 62.8 ± 0.8 Ma. Marshall et al. (1981, 1997) used these ages and palaeo-magnetic data to refer the overlaying BNI to polarity subchron C26r (= Danian Stage).

The discovery occurred when a fortuitous fin kick by a cave diver removed silt that was covering the dorsal portion of the carapace. Recovery required several dives to acquire the entire specimen. The only damage to the shell was a single crack in the carapace. The skull and postcranial bones were found in association with the shell. Photos and a video (8:11 min) by Pittaro and Lehman show the retrieval of the specimen. These images are archived on Vimeo (https://vimeo.com/197976404 ). Phillip Lehman brought the specimen to the attention of A.L.R., who alerted N.A.A. and R.F. of its discovery. It was brought to the AMNH for final reconstruction and study with permissions from R.R. and MHD.

The snake material we studied was collected at the Talisma  locality, which is considered by some authors as belonging to the Huayquerian- Montehermosan (Late Miocene/Pliocene) because of the presence of the rodents Potamarchus murinus and Neopliblema horridula (Santos et al., 1993; Negri, 2004). According to Santos and Negri (1993), the faunal set of xenarthrans (Tardigrada) suggests, on one hand, a probable affinity with the fauna of the Santacrucian Age of Argentina (Early-Middle Miocene) and, on the other, a relation with the Laventan Age of Colombia (Middle Miocene). According to Negri (2004; unpubl. data), the faunistic association of Tardigrada in this locality would indicate an older age, correlatable and close to the Laventan (13.5–11.8 Ma, Madden et al., 1997). Here, we follow the arguments of Latrubesse et al. (2007) and assume a probable Late Miocene age for the Solimo es Formation."" (Hsiou and Albino, 2009:613)\r\n\r\nCozzuol 2006: The diachronic nature of the Mesopotamian assemblage was rejected by Cozzuol (1993) and, more recently and with more complete data, by Cione et al. (2000). Surprisingly, several authors still insist on the ‘mixed’ nature of the ‘Conglomerado osı´fero’ (Linares, 2004; Zucol et al., 2005). All specimens from the Mesopotamian come from the base of the Ituzaingo´ Formation and concentrate in discontinuous lenticular levels (probably channel filling) known as the ‘Conglomerado osı´fero’ (i.e. bone-bearing conglomerate), which lies on the marine Parana´ Formation with an erosional unconformity between them. Cione et al. (2000) show that there is no basis for considering the Mesopotamian mammals Montehermosan. The Mesopotamian shares with the Chasicoan 18 first generic occurrences (plus 2 more with doubts) and 28 (plus another possible 4) first generic occurrences with the typical Huayquerian. With the constraints imposed by the underlying Parana´ Formation, the upper section of which was dated by several biostratigraphic studies as early Late Miocene (early Tortonian), this information places the Mesopotamian associ- ation well in the Huayquerian SALMA time interval (9.0– 6.8 Ma, Flynn and Swisher, 1995). As shown subsequently, the affinities between the Acre assemblage and the Mesopotamian are very large.\r\n\r\nSantos et al 1993: :Idade Huayqueriense-Montehermosense, Mioceno superior-Plioceno do sudoeste do Estado do Amazonas, Brasil.","dominated by fine sediments, mainly silts and clays, with gypsum and calcite veins in the lower part and manganese stains in the upper part, both probably diagenetic.\r\n\r\n""The section is dominated by fine sediments, mainly silts and clays, with gypsum and calcite veins in the lower part and manganese stains in the upper part, both probably digenetic.

The snake material we studied was collected at the Talisma  locality, which is considered by some authors as belonging to the Huayquerian- Montehermosan (Late Miocene/Pliocene) because of the presence of the rodents Potamarchus murinus and Neopliblema horridula (Santos et al., 1993; Negri, 2004). According to Santos and Negri (1993), the faunal set of xenarthrans (Tardigrada) suggests, on one hand, a probable affinity with the fauna of the Santacrucian Age of Argentina (Early-Middle Miocene) and, on the other, a relation with the Laventan Age of Colombia (Middle Miocene). According to Negri (2004; unpubl. data), the faunistic association of Tardigrada in this locality would indicate an older age, correlatable and close to the Laventan (13.5–11.8 Ma, Madden et al., 1997). Here, we follow the arguments of Latrubesse et al. (2007) and assume a probable Late Miocene age for the Solimo es Formation."" (Hsiou and Albino, 2009:613)\r\n\r\nCozzuol 2006: The diachronic nature of the Mesopotamian assemblage was rejected by Cozzuol (1993) and, more recently and with more complete data, by Cione et al. (2000). Surprisingly, several authors still insist on the ‘mixed’ nature of the ‘Conglomerado osı´fero’ (Linares, 2004; Zucol et al., 2005). All specimens from the Mesopotamian come from the base of the Ituzaingo´ Formation and concentrate in discontinuous lenticular levels (probably channel filling) known as the ‘Conglomerado osı´fero’ (i.e. bone-bearing conglomerate), which lies on the marine Parana´ Formation with an erosional unconformity between them. Cione et al. (2000) show that there is no basis for considering the Mesopotamian mammals Montehermosan. The Mesopotamian shares with the Chasicoan 18 first generic occurrences (plus 2 more with doubts) and 28 (plus another possible 4) first generic occurrences with the typical Huayquerian. With the constraints imposed by the underlying Parana´ Formation, the upper section of which was dated by several biostratigraphic studies as early Late Miocene (early Tortonian), this information places the Mesopotamian associ- ation well in the Huayquerian SALMA time interval (9.0– 6.8 Ma, Flynn and Swisher, 1995). As shown subsequently, the affinities between the Acre assemblage and the Mesopotamian are very large.\r\n\r\nSantos et al 1993: :Idade Huayqueriense-Montehermosense, Mioceno superior-Plioceno do sudoeste do Estado do Amazonas, Brasil.","dominated by fine sediments, mainly silts and clays, with gypsum and calcite veins in the lower part and manganese stains in the upper part, both probably diagenetic.\r\n\r\n""The section is dominated by fine sediments, mainly silts and clays, with gypsum and calcite veins in the lower part and manganese stains in the upper part, both probably digenetic.

It was previously dated by pollen analysis, mammal stratigraphy, and an unpublished radiometric K/Ar analysis as late Paleocene (see Kedves & Russell 1982). However, several lines of more recent evidence indicate an older, middle Paleocene (Selandian) age, of about 60-61 Ma. Paleomagnetic studies reveal that the eruption took place during a reversed interval (Kedves & Russell 1982). Fossils of the mammal Plesiadapis from Menat enable the locality to be connected to the biostratigraphic framework established in the Western Interior USA that relies extensively on this genus (Gingerich 1976; Secord et al. 2006). The abundance of the genus, its rapid evolution, and its Holarctic dispersal history allow species of Plesiadapis to play an important role in the zonation of Paleocene continental sediments and in correlation of faunas on both sides of the North Atlantic (e.g., Gingerich 1976). Two remarkable skeletons of P. insignis, one of them nearly complete, have been found in lake deposits at Menat, and this species closely compares to P. praecursor / P. anceps in North America (pers. comm. P. Gingerich August 2008). This suggests an early Selandian age, equivalent to the early Tiffanian Ti-1/Ti-2 land mammal biozonation sensu Secord et al. (2006) (see also Gingerich 1976; Russell 1967, 1975). In North America, the Ti1 and Ti2 biozones occur within magnetic polarity Chron 26r (Secord et al. 2006), consistent with the reversed polarity of the Menat sediments.",spongo-diatomitic,diatomite,,,,,,,,,,crater lake,volcanic basin,Volcanic Paleolake (maar) deposit,"macrofossils,mesofossils",,,,,,,,mold/impression,,,,,,,,,,,,,taxonomic,"field collection,survey of museum collection",MNHN,,,,Piton,,,,paleoentomology,marine,,actively mobile,,,carnivore,,,,hydroxyapatite,,,

The layers I, III, IV and VI were associated to the same outcrop section in the Telefunkenstation (telegraph station) site (de Greve, 1938), while layers II and V cropped up in other two different sites along the banks of the Itaya River. So far, no vertebrate specimens in the Iquitos collection has been associated either with layer V. Two other layers, including one from the lignite bank, and one of indeterminate location from Itaya (Table 1), were not referred to by de Greve (1938). From these we could not find any invertebrate/ vertebrate remains associated to the layer of indeterminate location from Itaya. In contrast, from the lignite bank layer, labelled as Telefunkenstation (blue in Table 1), which is referred to here for the first time as “layer VII”, abundant fish remains, and coprolites are identified (Table 2). According to de Greve (1938), there was a bone-bed layer between the two main lignite layers at the Telefunkenstation site, which was characterized by abundant bone splinters and fish remains. The lignite bank layer VII contains abundant fish remains and bone fragments that could suggest a match with the bone-bed layer referred to by de Greve (1938).

The vertebrate site is represented by a small exposure of lacustrine clay in a road cut near the village of Oschiri (De Bruijn and Rümke, 1974). The age of the mammal assemblage of Oschiri has been discussed by several authors (e.g. De Bruijn and Rümke, 1974; Azzaroli and Guazzone, 1979; Azzaroli, 1983; Van der Made, 2008). The micromammals are quite diverse, with nine taxa including seven endemic species (De Bruijn and Rümke, 1974). The advanced endemism of Ctenodactylidae and the presence of Gliridae, Talpidae and Soricidae are very similar to the mainland taxa, and suggest different phases of colonization of the Corsica Sardinia Massif (Ferrandini et al., 2000; Mennecart et al., 2017, 2019). The Oligo-Miocene palaeogeographical context of the western Mediterranean indicates that the latest additions to the insular association arrived in Sardinia during the European Land Mammal Unit MN3, which is coincident with the early Burdigalian marine regression, around 20 Ma ago (Van der Made, 2008; Zoboli and Pillola, 2017b).","""lignitic clay deposit""",claystone,,,,,lignite,,,,,fluvial-lacustrine indet.,rift,"The Oschiri locality belongs to the Oligocene-Miocene Sardinia rift graben which is connected to the decoupling of the Sardinia-Corsica block from the southern margin of Europe (see, e.g. Carminati et al., 2012, pp. 434-473 in Roberts & Bally (eds.))","macrofossils,mesofossils",,,,,,,,body,,,,,,,,,,,,,taxonomic,,,,,,,,,,vertebrate,marine,,actively mobile,,,carnivore,,,,hydroxyapatite,,,

The composite mean estimates for the Shapaja section are all very close to those for Santa Rosa, differing by only 0.42 to 1.0 My across analyses with both broad (effectively “unknown”) and more restricted age priors.
